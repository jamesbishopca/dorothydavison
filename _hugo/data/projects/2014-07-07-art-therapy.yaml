description: Art therapy is a powerful tool for reaching your unconscious thoughts and feelings around issues. Using pictures instead of words, you will see where changes need to be made to achieve a healthier sense of well-being without emotional pain or trauma. In 2012, Dorothy attended the Art Therapy Symposium at the Chebucto Art Therapy & Counselling Centre.
