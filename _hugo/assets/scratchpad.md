### Group Therapy
Group therapy is a life-changing experience that will help you to build the skills needed to thrive rather than survive. Dorothy has previously done group sessions on art therapy for coping with grief, on establishing healthy boundaries, and providing support to adult children of alcoholics and their families.

### Journalling
Journalling is a comforting form of self-expression that will help you to gain greater insight into your daily life. The journal can be used to identify changes that need to be made to ensure that you are better equipped to overcome your day-to-day challenges.

### Art Therapy
Art therapy is a powerful tool for reaching your unconscious thoughts and feelings around issues. Using pictures instead of words, you will see where changes need to be made to achieve a healthier sense of well-being without emotional pain or trauma. In 2012, Dorothy attended the Art Therapy Symposium at the Chebucto Art Therapy & Counselling Centre.

### Dream Interpretation
Dreams are an untapped gift and an avenue to healing and self-discovery. Using the techniques outlined by Carl Jung, you will be able to tap into the subconscious mind, bypassing the mundane and ordinary experiences of life, and access the wealth and wisdom of the psyche.

Family therapy will help you to build greater communication and interaction between the members of your family. By communicating openly and honestly, you will gain a greater understanding of the family dynamic and where it needs to be, and be on the path to a healthier lifestyle.
